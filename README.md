The Language Flashcard App is a simple yet effective tool I built to practice my German Word Knowledge. 

## Description:
It quizzes on different random words out of the most used words. If you get it right, you don't see the word again. If you get it wrong, it gets saved in another file. 
The second time you open the file, You will be quizzed based on the words you got wrong.

## Setup
Simple to setup. Unfortunately can't upload the installer because it is bigger than 25 MB (not allowed on GitHub). 
So, you will have to compile this one yourself. You also need to download the image files from the assets folder. Don't forget to manage the file paths.
