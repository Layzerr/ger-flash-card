The Language Flashcard App is a simple yet effective tool I built to practice my German Word Knowledge. 

## Description:
It quizzes on different random words out of the most used words. If you get it right, you don't see the word again. If you get it wrong. It gets saved in another file. 
The second time you open the file, You will be quized based on the words you got wrong.
